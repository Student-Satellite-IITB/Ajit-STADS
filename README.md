## Student Satellite Project - Indian Institude of Technology, Bombay

### Ajit-STADS proposal

STADS stands for Star Tracker based Attitude Determination system. Our aim is build an indegeneous star tracker, ground test it and later test it on PS4-OP platform.
This repository contains relevant codes and documentation of different algorithms used in our system


## Note
 1. Centroid extraction (Feature Extraction)
 >   * Repo currently has C++ codes, C- codes will be added soon
 >  *  Inputs to Centroid extraction code are Image_n.txt files, added in FE_test cases folder
>  *  Outputs to Centroid extraction code are st_input_n.txt files, added in Star matching test cases folder. (Output from CE block is input to the star matching block)

2. Star Matching
> * Documentaion and resources are added, C-codes will be added soon

2. Estimation
> * Documentaion, resources and C-codes will be added soon.
